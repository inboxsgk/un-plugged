</p>
<br>

## What’s the problem?
Laptop batteries wear out in time. Their charge doesn’t last more than a few minutes when unplugged. This crashes the system, breaking your workflow. It’s frustrating when your laptop suddenly force shuts down when you were working and didn't notice the charger is unplugged/switched off/or there's powercut in your home.

## What does this project do?
This program notifies you whenever there is no external power supply to the system (irrespective of the battery level). Sends a notification till the power source is restored.
