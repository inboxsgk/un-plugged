# Project Un-plugged: Receive alert if laptop charger is removed

## What’s the problem?
Laptop batteries die within a few years of usage. Their charge doesn’t last more than a few minutes when unplugged. This crashes the system, breaking your workflow. It’s frustrating when you don’t really notice the charger is removed/switch is off/or powercut in your home.


## What does this project do?
This program notifies you whenever there is no external power supply to the system (irrespective of the battery level). Sends a notification once again when the power source is restored.

## Your Contributions
All your contributions are welcome, whether it's a upgrade or fixing of bugs or anything. You can always contribute :)
